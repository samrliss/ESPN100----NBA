# ESPN100--->NBA
To follow through with my hypothesis that Tony Bennett (the men's basketball coach of the University of Virginia) has been better than his Division I NCAA coaching counterparts at developing top high school basketball talent into NBA level prospects, I conducted exploratory data analysis using data that I had extracted from both espn.com as well as basketball-reference.com. 

Using these two sources, I created a dataframe that provided the names of all top 100 high school basketball recruits from 2007-2015, the college they attended, and whether or not they made the NBA. To extract this data from these websites, I used the chrome extension SelectorGadget. Although frequency analysis suggested that Bennett had a higher successs rate at developing NBA talent than many of his peers, I could not reach any significant conclusions given the relatively small size of the data. 

Unrelated to my hypothesis, in analyzing Bennett's success over his tenure I had discovered an interesting trend: despite Bennett's overwhelming success with recruits from 2010 to 2015, at the beggining of his tenure, Bennett actually struggled with developing top recruits. After noticing this trend and conducting background research on the subject, I wrote a feature article for my university's studen-run newspaper, the Cavalier Daily, that investigated Bennettâ€™s failure to adopt these early top-100 players. Above, you may find a link to this article as well as a link to the version of this article that I helped translate into Spanish.
